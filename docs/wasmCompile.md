## Frequently Used Flags
- `--target=wasm32-unkown-wasi` for compiling to wasm
- `-c` for compiling as a library without main executable
- `-pthread` then the compiler to understand `__tls_base` etc
- `--sysroot` specifying the stand library path

## Modify stubs.h
Modify the file `stubs.h` located in `lind-wasm/glibc/target/include/gnu` to

```
/* This file is automatically generated.
   This file selects the right generated file of `__stub_FUNCTION' macros
   based on the architecture being compiled for.  */


//#if !defined __x86_64__
//# include <gnu/stubs-32.h>
//#endif
#if defined __x86_64__ && defined __LP64__
# include <gnu/stubs-64.h>
#endif
#if defined __x86_64__ && defined __ILP32__
# include <gnu/stubs-x32.h>
#endif
```

## Compile C to wasm
If you don't need to use glibc, modify `add.c` to the c file you want to compile and `add.wasm` is the wasm file you get(you can modify add to the name you want). Modify `/home/wasi-sdk/build/install/bin/clang-18` to you compiler's path

```
/home/wasi-sdk/build/install/bin/clang-18 --target=wasm32 -nostdlib -Wl,--no-entry -Wl,--export-all -o add.wasm add.c
```

If you need to use glibc(such as printf, printf.c is located in lind-wasm/lind-wasm-tests), modify `printf.c` to the c file you want to compile and `printf.wasm` is the wasm file you get(you can modify printf to the name you want). Modify `/home/clang+llvm-16.0.4-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-22.04/bin/clang-16` to you compiler's path

```
/home/clang+llvm-16.0.4-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-22.04/bin/clang --target=wasm32-unknown-wasi --sysroot /home/lind-wasm/glibc/sysroot printf.c -g -O0 -o printf.wasm
```

You should get printf.wasm after compiling printf.c

## Run wasmtime
Run the `.wasm` file, modify the wasmtime path to your own

```
/home/lind-wasm/wasmtime/target/debug/wasmtime add.wasm
```

For printf.wasm, you should get `Hello World!`.
